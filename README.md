# Salary_Estimation
The AIML project focuses on estimating employee salaries using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, considering features such as age, education, capital gain, and hours per week. KNN is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. 

The project involves the following steps: data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, training the KNN model, and evaluation. The model learns patterns from the training data based on the specified features and their corresponding salaries. 

Once trained and evaluated, the KNN model can be used to predict the salary of new employees by providing their age, education, capital gain, and hours per week as input. KNN estimates the salary based on the similarity of the new employee's feature values to those of the training examples. 

This AIML project provides a valuable tool for estimating employee salaries based on important factors such as age, education, capital gain, and hours per week, leveraging the power of the KNN algorithm.
